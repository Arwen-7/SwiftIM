- Read receipts for 1-on-1 and group chats
- Message deduplication (O(1) lookup, 20-40% deduplication rate)
- Message loss detection and automatic recovery
- Incremental synchronization based on `seq`
- Message pagination (time and seq-based)
- Message search with multi-dimensional filtering (< 50ms)

#### **Rich Media**
- Image messages with thumbnail generation and compression (60-84% rate)
